The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that uses a fixed number of positions to shift the letters in the plaintext message. It is a type of substitution cipher, where each letter of the given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used it to communicate with his officials.
The Caesar cipher works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the "shift" or "key". For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
